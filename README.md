# The-Shopping-List

To play the game, make sure you have a touch screen device, as touch controls are used.
Here are the direct intstructions from the game:
"Directions:
Use the joysticks to move around the market. The left is for movement, while the right is for rotation. Move near objects with targets to collect them. Tap the list button to access what you need to collect, then hit the X button to close the list. Targets will disappear from the items, and items on the list will disappear as you collect them. Beware of the timer, because once it runs out, the game will end. Also watch out for wet floor signs as they will turn you around, and shopping carts because they will push you away. There is an exit button, and will take you back to this screen. If you tap the exit button, you will have to start over again when you enter the game. Happy shopping!"
I came to this idea after first developing a spark of it in my mind, then developing it after looking at I-Spy games, and with a little help from others more creative than myself. I used C# on Unity to develop the game. I did use modeling from TinkerCad, the only modeling site I know how to use, and grabbed sound effects and music from various places. I also constructed code using lots of searches on the internet, though I put it together myself. I hope you enjoy the game, however short it may be!
